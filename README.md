# Smart-Food-Delivery-System
A smart food delivery system by using different algorithms.
A food delivery simulation system that uses different pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, A*) to calculate the delivery time → and shows which algorithm is most efficient.
| Algorithm  | How it behaves in delivery                           |
| -----------| ---------------------------------------------------- |
| DFS        | Gets lost, not optimal path → slow                   |
| BFS        | Finds shortest in unweighted map                     |
| Dijkstra   | Finds shortest in real city with distances           |
| A          | Fastest because it uses heuristics (real-world like) |
✅ User selects restaurant <br>
✅ User selects delivery location / home
✅ System shows map (grid/city graph)
✅ Chooses algorithm (DFS/BFS/Dijkstra/A*)
✅ Visualizes the travel path
✅ Calculates delivery time
✅ Compares which algorithm is fastest
